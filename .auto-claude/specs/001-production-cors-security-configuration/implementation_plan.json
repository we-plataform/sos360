  "feature": "Production CORS Security Configuration - Chrome Extension ID Validation",
  "workflow_type": "refactor",
  "workflow_rationale": "This is a REFACTOR workflow because we're changing security behavior from allowing all Chrome extensions to only allowing a specific extension ID. The change follows a stage-based approach: 1) Add new CHROME_EXTENSION_ID environment variable and validation logic alongside the existing permissive code, 2) Test that the extension still works in development, 3) Update deployment documentation to use the new secure pattern, 4) Verify production deployment works with the new configuration. This staged approach ensures no breaking changes during deployment and allows for testing before removing the old permissive behavior.",

    "reasoning": "High risk change because this modifies security-critical CORS configuration. A security vulnerability exists where ANY Chrome extension can access the API. The fix requires careful validation to ensure: 1) Production mode properly validates extension IDs, 2) Development mode remains functional for local testing, 3) Socket.io CORS is also properly configured, 4) All documentation is updated to prevent re-introduction of the vulnerability. Security scanning is required to ensure no remaining permissive patterns exist. Staging deployment is required to test with real extension ID before production deployment."
