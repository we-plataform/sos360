  "task_description": "# Production CORS Security Configuration\n\nImplement proper CORS configuration using CHROME_EXTENSION_ID environment variable to secure API access from the Chrome extension in production. Ensure only the official extension can communicate with the API.\n\n## Rationale\nCritical security requirement for production deployment. Current development mode allows all chrome-extension:// origins which is a security vulnerability. Must be secured before public launch.\n\n## User Stories\n- As a security-conscious developer, I want CORS properly configured so that only authorized extensions can access the API\n- As a user, I want the extension to work reliably in production without CORS errors\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] CHROME_EXTENSION_ID environment variable is documented in deployment guide\n- [ ] API validates extension origin in production mode\n- [ ] Only the official extension ID can access API endpoints\n- [ ] Development mode still allows localhost origins for testing\n- [ ] CORS errors no longer occur in production environment\n",
