=== AUTO-BUILD PROGRESS ===

Project: Extension Performance Optimization
Workspace: /Users/farinelli/Documents/Projects/lia360-web/.auto-claude/worktrees/tasks/009-extension-performance-optimization
Started: 2025-01-27

Workflow Type: feature
Rationale: This is a feature enhancement that requires multiple phases of optimization across the extension codebase. While it involves only the extension service, the complexity requires phased implementation: benchmarking, code splitting, lazy loading, memory optimization, event optimization, API optimization, and final verification.

Session 1 (Planner):
- Created implementation_plan.json
- Created project_index.json (monorepo structure)
- Created context.json (performance issues documented)
- Phases: 8
- Total subtasks: 24
- Created init.sh

Phase Summary:
- Phase 1 - Setup & Performance Baseline: 3 subtasks, depends on []
- Phase 2 - Code Splitting & Modularization: 3 subtasks, depends on [phase-1-setup]
- Phase 3 - Lazy Loading Implementation: 3 subtasks, depends on [phase-2-split]
- Phase 4 - Memory Optimization: 3 subtasks, depends on [phase-3-lazy]
- Phase 5 - Event Listener Optimization: 3 subtasks, depends on [phase-4-memory]
- Phase 6 - API Optimization: 3 subtasks, depends on [phase-5-events]
- Phase 7 - Build Optimization: 4 subtasks, depends on [phase-6-api]
- Phase 8 - Performance Verification & Documentation: 3 subtasks, depends on [phase-7-build]

Services Involved:
- extension: Chrome extension code optimization (only service affected)

Key Performance Issues Identified:
- Large content scripts: instagram.js (5714 lines), linkedin-dom.js (1077 lines)
- No code splitting or lazy loading
- Multiple setInterval pollers throughout
- Memory leaks: Map objects without cleanup
- MutationObservers watching entire document.body
- 10+ event listeners without cleanup logic
- No minification or bundling
- API calls without batching or debouncing

Parallelism Analysis:
- Max parallel phases: 1
- Recommended workers: 1
- Parallel groups: None - each phase builds on previous optimizations
- Speedup estimate: Sequential approach ensures each optimization is validated before building on it

Performance Targets:
- Load time: <500ms on social media sites
- Memory usage: <50MB during normal operation
- Scroll performance: No noticeable impact
- Stability: Handle network errors gracefully

=== STARTUP COMMAND ===

To continue building this spec, run:

  source .auto-claude/.venv/bin/activate && python .auto-claude/run.py --spec 009 --parallel 1

=== SESSION 2 (2025-01-27) ===

Subtask 1-2: Create performance benchmark script ✅
- Created: apps/extension/scripts/benchmark.js
- Features:
  * Analyzes all extension JavaScript files
  * Measures file sizes, line counts, code complexity
  * Groups scripts by platform (LinkedIn, Instagram, Facebook)
  * Estimates load time and memory impact
  * Saves baseline metrics to benchmark-results.json
  * Supports --baseline, --compare, and --help flags

Baseline Results:
- Total Extension Size: 355.18KB
- Total Lines: 9,551
- Code Lines: 7,251
- Largest File: instagram.js (195.38KB, 5715 lines)
- Platform breakdown:
  * Instagram: 200.35KB (largest)
  * LinkedIn: 106.26KB
  * Shared: 31.86KB
  * Facebook: 9.14KB
  * Dashboard: 7.58KB

Performance Target Assessment:
- Load Time Estimate: ~36s (needs optimization - target <500ms)
- Memory Estimate: ~355MB (needs optimization - target <50MB)

Next: Subtask 1-3 - Document baseline metrics in PERFORMANCE.md

=== SESSION 3 (2025-01-27) ===

Subtask 3-1: Create lightweight bootstrap script that dynamically loads platform-specific modules ✅
- Created: apps/extension/content-scripts/bootstrap.js (217 lines, 7.2KB)
- Features:
  * Detects current platform from URL patterns (Instagram, LinkedIn, Facebook, Dashboard)
  * Dynamically loads only required platform-specific scripts using chrome.runtime.getURL
  * Lazy loading reduces initial parse time and memory usage
  * Prevents double initialization with global check
  * Follows IIFE pattern from settings-manager.js
  * Comprehensive error handling with try-catch blocks
  * Dispatches custom events: 'lia-bootstrap-complete' and 'lia-bootstrap-error'
  * Tracks and logs load time for performance monitoring
  * Script deduplication to avoid loading the same script twice

Platform-Specific Script Loading:
- Instagram: 6 modules (utils, profile-import, post-import, followers-import, ui, main)
- LinkedIn: 7 modules (utils, state, selectors, extractors, dom, ui, core)
- Facebook: 1 module (main)
- Dashboard: 1 module (dashboard-sync)

Benefits:
- Only loads scripts needed for current platform
- Reduces initial JavaScript parsing overhead
- Enables parallel script loading within platform
- Provides better error isolation
- Includes performance metrics for monitoring

Verification Notes:
- Manual verification required: Load LinkedIn page and check DevTools to verify only bootstrap + linkedin modules load
- Will be fully integrated in subtask 3-3 when manifest.json is updated to use bootstrap.js as sole initial content script

Next: Subtask 3-2 - Implement feature detection to load overlay UI only when on search/connections pages

=== END SESSION 3 ===
=== SESSION 4 (2025-01-27) ===

Subtask 3-3: Update manifest.json to use bootstrap.js as only content script initially ✅
- Modified: apps/extension/manifest.json
- Changes:
  * Consolidated content_scripts from 4 separate entries to 2 unified entries
  * All social platforms (Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn) now load only bootstrap.js
  * Dashboard also loads bootstrap.js for consistency
  * Removed direct loading of all platform-specific scripts from manifest
  * Updated web_accessible_resources to include all dynamically-loaded scripts:
    - bootstrap.js (the loader itself)
    - settings-manager.js (shared settings)
    - All Instagram modules (utils, profile-import, post-import, followers-import, ui, main)
    - Facebook script
    - All LinkedIn modules (utils, state, selectors, extractors, dom, ui, core)
    - dashboard-sync.js
    - Icons and overlay.css

Lazy Loading Flow:
1. Extension loads bootstrap.js on any supported platform
2. Bootstrap detects current platform from URL
3. Bootstrap dynamically loads only required scripts for that platform
4. Scripts loaded via chrome.runtime.getURL() and web_accessible_resources

Benefits:
- Significantly reduced initial JavaScript parse time (only 7.2KB bootstrap.js vs 195KB+)
- Lower memory footprint (unused platform scripts never load)
- Faster page load on social media sites
- Better code organization and maintainability
- Easier to add new platforms or modify existing ones

JSON Validation:
- Confirmed manifest.json is valid JSON syntax

Verification Notes:
- Manual verification required: Reload extension and test on LinkedIn, Instagram, Facebook
- Should see only bootstrap.js in initial Sources panel
- Platform-specific scripts should appear after bootstrap loads them dynamically
- Console should show bootstrap logging: "[Lia Bootstrap] Platform detected: ..."

Performance Impact:
- Initial load: ~7.2KB (bootstrap.js only)
- Platform-specific: Loads only needed scripts dynamically
- LinkedIn: ~106KB loads only on LinkedIn (not on Instagram/Facebook)
- Instagram: ~200KB loads only on Instagram (not on LinkedIn/Facebook)

Next: Subtask 3-2 - Implement feature detection to load overlay UI only when on search/connections pages
